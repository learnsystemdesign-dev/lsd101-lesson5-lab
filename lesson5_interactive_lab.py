üîç Your Service vs Queue + Worker Discoveries:
   ‚Ä¢ Service building block: Blocking operations create terrible user experiences
   ‚Ä¢ Queue building block: Enables message persistence, routing, and load balancing
   ‚Ä¢ Worker building block: Provides non-blocking background processing power
   ‚Ä¢ Service alone: Sequential, blocking, single point of failure
   ‚Ä¢ Queue + Worker together: Responsive, scalable, resilient systems
   ‚Ä¢ Queue distribution enables horizontal scaling across multiple Workers
   ‚Ä¢ Queue + Worker fault isolation prevents system-wide failures

üìä Your Building Block Comparison Times:
   ‚Ä¢ Service Building Block: {self.experiment_times.get('experiment_1', 0):.1f}s (UI frozen entire time)
   ‚Ä¢ Queue + Worker: {self.experiment_times.get('experiment_2', 0):.1f}s (UI always responsive)
   ‚Ä¢ Queue ‚Üí Multiple Workers: {self.experiment_times.get('experiment_3', 0):.1f}s (distributed processing)
   ‚Ä¢ Queue + Worker Resilience: {self.experiment_times.get('experiment_4', 0):.1f}s (handled failures gracefully)

üèóÔ∏è You now understand why these companies use Queue + Worker instead of Service alone:
   ‚Ä¢ Instagram: Queue routes photo jobs to Worker farms (not blocking Service calls)
   ‚Ä¢ Netflix: Queue distributes video encoding to Worker clusters (not sequential Service processing)
   ‚Ä¢ Gmail: Queue handles email delivery through Worker processes (not blocking Service requests)
   ‚Ä¢ Uber: Queue manages ride requests across Worker services (not single Service bottleneck)

üéì You've completed your architectural transformation! You now think like a senior engineer who understands:
   ‚Ä¢ When to use Service building blocks (fast, synchronous operations)
   ‚Ä¢ When to use Queue + Worker building blocks (scalable, resilient, async operations)
